# Experience Ecuador staging

This branch is the pre-production integration environment for the site-wide update.

## Safety controls

- Cloudflare serves `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet` from `_headers`.
- `assets/js/site.js` adds a matching robots meta directive on non-production hosts.
- GTM and GA4 are disabled on non-production hosts by default.
- Append `?ee_analytics_debug=1` once per browser session to enable analytics for GTM Preview and GA4 DebugView.
- Append `?ee_analytics_debug=0` to disable analytics again.
- A fixed staging banner identifies the environment and its analytics state.

## Promotion checklist

Before merging the release to `main`:

1. Complete desktop and mobile QA for every page cluster in English and Spanish.
2. Validate canonicals, hreflang, schema, internal links, redirects, forms and WhatsApp.
3. Run GTM Preview and GA4 DebugView with analytics debug enabled.
4. Remove `_headers` from the production release so the live site remains indexable.
5. Confirm `robots.txt` and the canonical sitemap are production-ready.
